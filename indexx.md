### CPSC 120

• Lab 3

In lab 3 part 1, we had to compare pizza size, price, and unit values. I enjoyed this lab because it applied mathematical principles to a real world scenario that we use with everyday life. This lab helped me with my programming skills by helping me practice Data Analysis and Unit Price Calculation. It also showed me how we can implement something we learn in class into a useful program that many might think is handy. This was one of the earlier labs we did, and it got me excited to learn more skills in the classroom.

• Lab 6

In lab 3 part 1, we created a program that would take user info to fill in blanks. I enjoyed this because it reminded me of a deli shop. It made me wonder how their cash registers are set up and if they use a similar way to write that software. To be able to interact with your code and print out results made me feel accomplished. These types of labs are what motivate me to continue learning. 

• Lab 7

Lab 7 part 2, was a great lab that tested both my coding skills as well as my commitment skills. I knew how to game blackjack was played but trying to configure the Ace rule was a bit of a challenge. I was having trouble trying to implement the Ace being valued at 1 or 11 depending on the hand. This took me a lot of extra researching to fully understand. At the end, I was able to successfully complete the lab and was proud of my dedication to the assignment.
